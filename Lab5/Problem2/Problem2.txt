Hypothesis:
first call to previous() returns t, second call returns f
r, e, f, t after adding 'e' then 'r'
first call to next() returns 'r'
r, e, c, e, f, t after two more adds
p, r, e, c, e, f, t on final println()

Actual:
after inserting f, next index is 1
inserts t after f, next() would return element after f if called right after inserting f, increment nextIndex to 2
after inserting t, next index is 2, call to previous makes it 1 then another call makes it 0. 
e is inserted before f, next index is then incremented to 1, r is inserted before f, next index incremented to 2
next() increments next index to 3
e is inserted before t, next index incremented to 4
c is inserted before t, next index incremented to 5
